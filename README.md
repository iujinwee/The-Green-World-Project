# The-Green-World-Project

## Introduction 
### Context of The Green World Project
Our report intends to shed light on the gaps in sustainability knowledge as well as highlight the urgency of tackling environmental issues through the use of data-driven findings. Through this report, we hope that our readers will better grasp and understand the impact of our actions on climate change and take steps to mitigate this dire environmental problem.

### Differences between Relational & Non-relational Implementation
Relational database is a structured schema with multiple tables linked by well-defined relationships, containing normalised data. On the other hand, non-relational databases run on a schemaless structure with multiple embedded documents storing different data structures using key-value pairs. Fundamentally, their structures differ significantly which ultimately leads to different database implementations.
